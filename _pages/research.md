There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.
*I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil candidates for providing me with the research opportunities and hand-on experiences below.*

### 1. **online Easy Example Mining for Weakly-supervised Gland Segmentation from Histology Images (Final Year Project)** *(Sep. 2021 - June. 2022)* *MICCAI 2022 Accepted* [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06665.pdf)

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/), Assistant Professor, Associate Director of Center for Medical Imaging and Analysis)*

* We point out that the key problem of gland segmentation is the confusion caused by the homogeneity of histology images, rather than the local activation problem that most WSSS methods in computer vision try to solve.
* We propose the Online Easy Example Mining (OEEM) to mine the credible supervision signals in pseudo-mask with proposed normalized loss, thus mitigating the damage of confused supervisions for gland segmentation.
* We design a strong framework for gland segmentation. Our fully-supervised and proposed weakly-supervised OEEM surpasses the existing fully- and weakly-supervised methods for gland segmentation, respectively.

### 2. **Exploring the Effects of Self-Mockery to Improve Task-oriented Chatbot’s Social Intelligence** *(Jan. – Sep. 2021)*  *DIS 2022 Accepted* [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3532106.3533461)

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/), Associate Professor, Human-Computer Interaction Initiative, HKUST)* 

* We design and evaluate the pipeline to generate self-mockery language for task-oriented chatbots.
* Provide empirical insights from a within-subject study to understand the factors that infuence the perceived social intelligence of the task-oriented chatbots with self-mockery design.
* Followed the first half of the project as an undergraduate research assistant, name appears in Acknowledgement.

### 3. **Lung Tumor Segmentation and Drug Resistance Prediction Through Novel Deep Learning Architectures** *(Jun. – Aug. 2021)*

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/), Assistant Professor, Associate Director of Center for Medical Imaging and Analysis)*

* This project aims to use nnUnet to segment out the lung cancer and do the Drug Resistance Prediction based on it. We add a classification branch at the lowest level of the segmentation network and utiliz the multi-modality training technique. 
* Preprocess and postprecess are carried out to facilitate training.
