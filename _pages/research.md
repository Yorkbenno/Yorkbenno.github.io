This part is to be updated shortly............

There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.
**I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil candidates for providing me with the research opportunities and
hand-on experiences below.**

### 1. **WSSS4LUAD: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma Diagnosis (Final Year Project)** *(Sep. 2021 - Now)*

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/), Assistant Professor, Associate Director of Center for Medical Imaging and Analysis)*

* This is a project from the [Grand Challenge Website](https://wsss4luad.grand-challenge.org/WSSS4LUAD/). Our goal is to do tissue segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma Diagnosis 
    with only image-level classification labels provided. 
* We proposed a pipeline using Class Activation Map(CAM) as our initial pesudo-mask and utilized the Cyclic Pseudo-mask and the Pretended Underfitting Strategy 
to train our final segmentation model SEAM. We achieved a competitive results at the end.

### 2. **Lung Tumor Segmentation and Drug Resistance Prediction Through Novel Deep Learning Architectures** *(Jun. – Aug. 2021)*

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaomeng Li](https://xmengli.github.io/), Assistant Professor, Associate Director of Center for Medical Imaging and Analysis)*

* To be update

### 3. **Exploring the Effects of Self-Mockery to Improve Task-oriented Chatbot’s Social Intelligence** *(Jan. – Sep. 2021)*

#### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/), Associate Professor, Human-Computer Interaction Initiative, HKUST)*

* To be update
