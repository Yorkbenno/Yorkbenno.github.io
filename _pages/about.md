## About me

I am currently a student for the Master of Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a minor in General Business from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (First Class Honors + Academic Achievement Medal), where I worked with Prof. Raymond Wong, Prof. Xiaojuan Ma and Prof. Xiaomeng Li. My interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, Medical Image Analysis, and Deep Learning.
